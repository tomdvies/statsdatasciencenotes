Notes from the 2024-2025 Edinburgh Statistics and Data Science Msc
These are notes that were taken in 2024 for various courses. 
They were mostly taken live in lectures, in particular, all errors are almost surely mine.
If lecture notes were provided (publically or with expressed permission to share), they will also be linked at the header of the notes.
